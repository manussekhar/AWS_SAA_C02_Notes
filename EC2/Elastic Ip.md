Restarting an EC2 Instance will update its public ip.
An elastic ip is needed, if we need to have constant public ip.
We can reassign an Elastic Ip to EC2 Instances. At a given time a single EC2 instance can have a public ip.
By default one would get 5 Elastic Ip
Elastic ip address are used as long as they are used.
